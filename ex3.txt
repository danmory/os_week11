The difference in outputs of two programs is because of line buffering. 
In the 1st program before fork call the buffer is not empty(consists of work 'Hello') BUT
the 2nd one is empty because before fork buffer was cleaned after print command(using '\n' symbol in printf).
So, in the 1st program each of two processes will have buffer with word 'Hello' and 
in the 2nd program each of them will have empty buffer. 
When the final print occurs the 1st program will print two words 'Hello' on the different lines and
the 2nd one will print remaining empty lines.
